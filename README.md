## Recommended changes

### Add format on save

We're all working in the same codebase, so adding a format on save option will allow for more consistent code. Follow these steps to enable

1. Install `ESLint` through vscode extensions.
2. Install `Prettier - Code formatter` through vscode extensions.
3. In vscode, go to file -> preferences -> settings and search for `format`. Enable `format on save`.
4. In vscode settings, search for `default.formatter` and choose `prettier`

Now when you save, the file should format auomatically. You may need to restart vscode to see the changes.
